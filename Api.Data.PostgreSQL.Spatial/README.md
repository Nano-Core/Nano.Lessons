## Summary
This application builds on **[Api.Blank](https://github.com/Nano-Core/Nano.Lessons/tree/master/Api._Blank)** and adds a test controller that inherits from 
the Nano `BaseEntityControllerr<TEntity, TCriteria>`. The available entity endpoints are inherited, and no additional endpoints has been added.  

This example demonstrates how various parts of Nano data work together. All data configuration and registration have been completed, and classes have been implemented 
for the data parts, including [Data Models](https://github.com/Nano-Core/Nano.Library/tree/master/Nano.Data#data-models), [Data Mappings](https://github.com/Nano-Core/Nano.Library/tree/master/Nano.Data#data-mappings), 
and the [Data Context](https://github.com/Nano-Core/Nano.Library/tree/master/Nano.Data#data-context).  

Additionally, the example shows how Nano [Data Repository](https://github.com/Nano-Core/Nano.Library/tree/master/Nano.Data#repositories) works along with the corresponding 
entity controllers. For more information on controllers and how they are connected with entity models, see [Nano Entity Controllers](https://github.com/Nano-Core/Nano.Library/tree/master/Nano.App.Api#controllers).
